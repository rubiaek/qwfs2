# Two-Photon Wavefront Shaping: Unique Configurations and Quantum Optical Phase Conjugation

### Introduction

This repository contains the Python code implementation for the following publication:

> Ronen Shekel, SÃ©bastien M. Popoff and Yaron Bromberg. Two-Photon Wavefront Shaping: Unique Configurations and Quantum Optical Phase Conjugation. _in preparation_, 2025. 

**Abstract**: TODO


### Project Structure
- `qwfs_simulation.py`: The main simulation code.
- `qwfs_result.py`: Contains the QWFSResult class, that holds the data, and has saveto and loadfrom methods.
- `generate_results.ipynb`: A notebook for generating the results in the paper.
- `generate_results.ipynb`: A notebook using the output of `generate_results.ipynb` to generate the figures that are shown in the paper, as well as aditional figures. 
- `data\`: directory saving previously run restults
